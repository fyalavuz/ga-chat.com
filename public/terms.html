          <h2>7. Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time if we reasonably believe
            you violated these Terms or if it is necessary to protect the Service, users, or third
            parties. You may stop using the Service at any time.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
