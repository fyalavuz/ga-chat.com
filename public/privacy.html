          <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 4, 2026</p>

          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how GA Chat ("<strong>GA Chat</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>",
            "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>") collects, uses, and shares information when
            you use our website and related services (collectively, the "<strong>Service</strong>").
          </p>

          <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
          <p>
            The information we collect depends on how you use the Service. We may collect the following
            categories of information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Account information</strong> (if you create an account), such as your name,
              username, email address, and authentication data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User content</strong>, such as messages, files, and other content you submit or
              receive through the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage information</strong>, such as pages viewed, features used, interactions, and
              approximate location derived from IP address.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Device and log information</strong>, such as device type, operating system, browser
              type, and log data (including timestamps and diagnostic information).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Support communications</strong>, such as information you provide when you contact
              us for help.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. How we use information</h2>
          <p>We may use information to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Service.</li>
            <li>Authenticate users, enable core features, and personalize your experience.</li>
            <li>Monitor, prevent, and address fraud, abuse, security incidents, and technical issues.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you about updates, security alerts, and support messages.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms and policies.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
          <p>
            We may use cookies or similar technologies to operate the Service, remember preferences, and
            understand usage. You can usually adjust your browser settings to remove or reject cookies.
            If you disable cookies, some features may not function properly.
          </p>

          <h2>4. How we share information</h2>
          <p>We may share information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>With service providers</strong> who process information on our behalf (for example,
              hosting, analytics, customer support, and security).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>For legal reasons</strong> if we believe disclosure is required by law or necessary
              to protect rights, safety, or prevent fraud.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>In connection with a business transfer</strong> (such as a merger, acquisition, or
              sale of assets), where permitted by law.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
          <p>
            We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate and
            essential business purposes, such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes,
            and enforcing agreements. Retention periods vary depending on the type of information and
            how it is used.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Security</h2>
          <p>
            We take reasonable measures to help protect information, but no method of transmission or
            storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials
            confidential.
          </p>

          <h2>7. International data transfers</h2>
          <p>
            Your information may be processed in countries other than where you live. These countries
            may have different data protection laws. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for
            international transfers.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Your choices and rights</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or object to
            certain processing of your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw
            consent where processing is based on consent.

            The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or a higher age where required
            by law). If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us
            so we can take appropriate steps.
          </p>
